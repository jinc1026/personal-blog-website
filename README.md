# personal-blog-website

For the first project of Udacity's Front End Nano-degree course, I have built a personal blog website to sharpen my skills sets for html, css and responsive web design.

In this project, I've used both grid and flexbox layout for main page and page template in order to layout blog components.  In order to minimize the time spent on blog content, all text were generated using Lorem Ipsum.

On the main page, custom blog cards are created to display the title and summary of each blog and shadow in css is used to highlight each card when mouse hovers over the card.

For page layout, I've used grid system to dynamically change the width of the main image depending on the screen size.
